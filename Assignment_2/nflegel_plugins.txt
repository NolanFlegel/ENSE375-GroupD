Assignment 2, Part 3: Github plugins.


Code Quality:  CommitCheck
    This app creates hooks for commit messages. It uses regular expressions to check commit messages for known phrases and prevent unwanted pull requests from occurring.


Code Review: Typo CI
    Checks code for spelling mistakes and annotes code for review. It works automatically on pull requests.It supports a number of different languages.



How this affects my code:
    When I created a commit and pull request for my branch, the plugins checked my commit message and checked my code for spelling mistakes. I received messages in the github UI that marked my pull request as having passed the checks and I can proceed with my pull request and merge my code into the Main branch.
